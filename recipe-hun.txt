Rakott Krumpli is one of Hungary’s most favorite comfort foods. It contains a generous amount of sour cream along with potatoes and smoked Hungarian sausage which gives it a very rich and creamy taste.

Ingredients

8 medium red potatoes
3 large eggs
1 1/2 cup (300 grams) sour cream
1 smoked Hungarian sausage (hot or mild), thinly sliced
1/2 cup (100 grams) trappista or cheddar cheese, grated
salt, pepper
butter to grease casserole dish

Directions

Place potatoes in a large pot and bring to a boil. Cook potatoes until just tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water until cool enough to handle. Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch rounds. Set aside.

In another large pot, cook eggs until hard-boiled, about 10 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water until cool enough to handle. Peel the egg shells. Cut the hard-boiled eggs into 1/2-inch rounds. Set aside.

Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).

Butter bottom and sides of a medium casserole dish. Arrange 1/3 of potatoes in bottom of casserole dish. Cover with 1/3 of eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Cover with 1/3 of sausage followed by 1/3 of sour cream. Continue layering, ending with potato layer and sour cream on top. Sprinkle with grated cheese. Bake for about 40 minutes covered, then 10 minutes without cover until cheese is golden brown and bubbly.

Serve warm with fresh salad or pickled cucumber.
